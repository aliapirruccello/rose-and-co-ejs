# Optimizations

When I improve this project, I want to use a search menu to locate a client formula card to update it.
I would also like to have an edit button functionality on the client cards so that when it is edited, it will show the date that they were last in the salon.

# Lessons Learned

I learned how to use MVC to seperate concerns within the app.
