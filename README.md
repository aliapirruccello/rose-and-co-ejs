# Full Stack App to store Client Informatin
## This is an app that I was inspired to build for my hair styling needs 

Here is a link to the website: [(https://roseandco.cyclic.app/)]

# Tech used

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node, MongoDB, Express, EJS

# Optimizations

When I improve this project, I want to use a search menu to locate a client formula card to update it.
I would also like to have an edit button functionality on the client cards so that when it is edited, it will show the date that they were last in the salon.

# Lessons Learned

I learned how to use MVC to seperate concerns within the app.
